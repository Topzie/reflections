What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo there will be a hidden file created called .git, which contains all metadata on your git commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like storing information in a temporary file (cache). After you have put several files up there, you can commit them one by one with a meaningful description.
