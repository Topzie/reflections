Some reflections, not all, on lesson 3.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working on different computers and/or with other contributors.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Good question.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are clones on GitHub
clones are copies of repositories or branches
There's a master branche and you can commit other branches when you are trying something new, or working local before pushing it to remote.
